Main goal: Prevent APT(Advanced Persistent Threats)
Making Noise is not an option.
red team engagements consist of emulating a real threat actor's Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) so that we can measure how well our blue team responds.
It is important to note that the final objective of such exercises should never be for the red team to "beat" the blue team.
The goals of a red team engagement will often be referred to as flags or crown jewels.

- **Technical Infrastructure:** Like in a regular penetration test, a red team will try to uncover technical vulnerabilities, with a much higher emphasis on stealth and evasion.
- **Social Engineering:** Targeting people through phishing campaigns, phone calls or social media to trick them into revealing information that should be private.
- **Physical Intrusion:** Using techniques like lockpicking, RFID cloning, exploiting weaknesses in electronic access control devices to access restricted areas of facilities.
- **Full Engagement:** Simulate an attacker's full workflow, from initial compromise until final goals have been achieved.
- **Assumed Breach:** Start by assuming the attacker has already gained control over some assets, and try to achieve the goals from there. As an example, the red team could receive access to some user's credentials or even a workstation in the internal network.
- **Table-top Exercise:**  An over the table simulation where scenarios are discussed between the red and blue teams to evaluate how they would theoretically respond to certain threats. Ideal for situations where doing live simulations might be complicated.

Everyone will have their mindset and methodology to approach the engagement personnel; however, each engagement can be broken into three teams or cells.

**Red Cell**: A red cell is the component that makes up the offensive portion of a red team engagement that simulates a given target's strategic and tactical responses.
**Blue Cell**: The blue cell is the opposite side of red. It includes all the components defending a target network. The blue cell is typically comprised of blue team members, defenders, internal staff, and an organisation's management.
**White Cell**: Serves as referee between red cell activities and blue cell responses during an engagement. Controls the engagement environment/network. Monitors adherence to the ROE (Rules of Engagement). Coordinates activities required to achieve engagement goals. Correlates red cell activities with defensive actions. Ensures the engagement is conducted without bias to either side.

Since this is a red team-oriented, we will focus on the responsibilities of the red cell.
**Red Team Lead**: Plans and organises engagements at a high level—delegates, assistant lead, and operators engagement assignments.
**Red Team Assistant Lead**: Assists the team lead in overseeing engagement operations and operators. Can also assist in writing engagement plans and documentation if needed.
**Red Team Operator**: Executes assignments delegated by team leads. Interpret and analyse engagement plans from team leads.

A core function of the red team is adversary emulation. While not mandatory, it is commonly used to assess what a real adversary would do in an environment using their tools and methodologies.
The red team can use various cyber kill chains to summarize and assess the steps and procedures of an engagement.
The blue team commonly uses cyber kill chains to map behaviors and break down an adversaries movement. The red team can adapt this idea to map adversary TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to components of an engagement.

Many regulation and standardization bodies have released their cyber kill chain. Each kill chain follows roughly the same structure, with some going more in-depth or defining objectives differently.

"Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain", It is a more standardized kill chain than others and is very commonly used among red and blue teams.


| Technique             | Purpose                                                                           | Examples                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Reconnaissance        | Obtain information on the target                                                  | Harvesting emails, OSINT                         |
| Weaponization         | Combine the objective with an exploit. Commonly results in a deliverable payload. | Exploit with backdoor, malicious office document |
| Delivery              | How will the weaponized function be delivered to the target                       | Email, web, USB                                  |
| Exploitation          | Exploit the target's system to execute code                                       | MS17-010, Zero-Logon, etc.                       |
| Installation          | Install malware or other tooling                                                  | Mimikatz, Rubeus, etc.                           |
| Command & Control     | Control the compromised asset from a remote central controller                    | Empire, Cobalt Strike, etc.                      |
| Actions on Objectives | Any end objectives: ransomware, data exfiltration, etc.                           | Conti, LockBit2.0, etc.                          |
